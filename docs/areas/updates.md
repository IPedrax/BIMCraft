# Updates and installs

Moved from the root `CLAUDE.md`, word for word: the root keeps the rules and the map, and this file is read when the area is touched.

Updates (`crates/update`, drawn by `crates/ui-egui/src/updates.rs`). At startup the desktop asks `api.github.com` for the latest
release (`LATEST_URL`: never a draft or a pre-release) on a thread of its own, and compares its tag, `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, with the
running version as semver (`tag_version`, `is_newer`). Errors are quiet at startup and said in the status box when the user
asked (File > Check for Updates Now). A release whose installer isn't sound is still told of, with a Download button. The user's
choices are `update.json` beside the favorites (`Prefs`, `prefs::beside` the path `favorites::default_path` finds: `%APPDATA%\BIMCraft`,
`~/Library/Application Support/BIMCraft`, `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bimcraft` else `~/.config/bimcraft`, or the folder of the file
`BIMCRAFT_FAVORITES` names; the desktop's `main` hands it to `Updater::desktop`, because this crate doesn't depend on the core), never a project: whether to
check at startup, and the version they skipped (it and anything older are quiet at startup, a newer one is offered). The
environment variable `BIMCRAFT_NO_UPDATE_CHECK`, set to anything but empty, leaves the app with no updater at all. The release workflow must keep naming its
assets as `Target::asset_name` does (`bimcraft-<version>-windows-x64.msi` and the other two) and publish them with `gh release
create`, which is what makes GitHub give each a digest; rename an asset and updates quietly stop being installable. Which file of a release updates an install is the
`Target`: the Windows MSI, a Linux AppImage per `Arch` (`bimcraft-<version>-linux-<arch>.AppImage`) or the macOS disk image
(`bimcraft-<version>-macos-universal.dmg`); `parse_release(json, target)` takes that one and ignores the rest (the `.zsync`, the
packages, the tarball, the CLI's zip). `Install::detect()` (`detect.rs`) says which this program is and what an update would replace
(`Install { target, place }`: the AppImage file, the `.app` bundle, or the Windows program). It is none, so the release is only
told of, with a Download button, for a deb, rpm or Arch install (root's files), a tarball and a build from source. An AppImage or
a macOS app in a folder this user can't write in is told of the same way: `Install::replaceable` probes the folder, but only once
a check has found an update to offer (`fit`), never at startup, because the probe creates a file and some macOS folders (Documents,
Desktop) ask the user before an app may. A Flatpak has no network, so `Updater::desktop` makes no updater there
(`detect::in_flatpak`, `phones_home`). A release's `SHA256SUMS` (the
same workflow's, in `sha256sum`'s format), when it lists one, is asked for before the file (`cross_check`, `checksum_of`) and must
give the same sum as the API's digest; the API digest stays the one that has to exist. Restart and install is `Pending::Update`, so
unsaved changes are asked about first, and `Updater::install` then puts the update in place on a thread of its own: `State::Installing`,
then `Note::Installed` (the window closes) or `Note::InstallFailed` (the update is ready again, to try once more). While it runs a
box holds the window (`installing_box`; `guard`, `keys` and a close request all stand down while `installing()`), because the window
closes itself when the install is in and anything done meanwhile would be lost. The thread runs `Install::hand_over`, which
hashes the file again (it sat in the temp folder), replaces the install, and removes the update's `bimcraft-update-*` folder
(`detect::spent`: not the Windows one, which its copy still needs) only if that worked, so a failed install can be tried again.
On Windows, only the copy the installer put in
`%ProgramFiles%\BIMCraft` updates itself (`install::is_installed`). `install::start` copies the running program beside the
downloaded installer and starts the copy with
`--finish-update` (which `main` handles before anything else), with a pipe that ends when the app exits: the copy, which nothing
installs over, waits for that, checks that its arguments are what an update makes (`plausible`: anyone can run
`bimcraft --finish-update`, so the installer must be named for a version, in a `bimcraft-update-*` folder, and the program to
start again the one in Program Files), hashes the installer again through a handle held with `FILE_SHARE_READ` so that nothing can
swap it (should msiexec exit 1620, it lets go, checks again and runs unheld), runs `%SystemRoot%\System32\msiexec.exe /i …
/passive /norestart` by that full path (the copy's own folder is user-writable) and starts the app again with the project that
was open, whatever msiexec did. `installed_here` also refuses a copy that can write to its own folder (`writable`: that is an
administrator's, and the copy would run elevated from the temp folder). Folders `bimcraft-update-*` in the temp folder older
than a day are swept at each check, except the one an update ready to install (or being installed) is in, since the Windows copy can't remove itself.
A Linux AppImage replaces itself (`appimage.rs`), because Linux lets a running program's file be replaced: no helper copy.
`APPIMAGE` and `APPDIR` count only together with `current_exe()` lying under `APPDIR` (`detect::appimage_file`), and the file is
canonicalised, so a link updates the file it points to. The new file is copied beside the old (the same filesystem, so the last
`rename` is atomic), given the old one's mode plus execute, and run with `--version` as the user would run it and, if that fails,
once more with `APPIMAGE_EXTRACT_AND_RUN=1` (no FUSE needed), each under a time limit (`exec::run`: no input, 16 KiB of output kept,
killed at the limit). It must print `bimcraft <version>` exactly (`exec::says_version`, with `version_line`, which the desktop's
`--version` prints too so that rewording one can't strand the other; a release tagged without bumping `Cargo.toml` is refused,
rightly, since it would offer itself again) before it is renamed over the old one and started with the project (made absolute by
`Updater::install`, since macOS's `open` starts the app with `/` as its folder) and none of the old run's `APPIMAGE`, `APPDIR`,
`ARGV0` or `OWD`, and asked to unpack itself too if it had to be to run. The staged names are predictable (they hold the process
id), so they are made exclusively (`create_new`, `create_dir`): a name someone planted as a link is an error, never written through.
The macOS app (`macos.rs`) is the same idea with more steps: `hdiutil attach -readonly -nobrowse -noverify`, `ditto` of BIMCraft.app
to a hidden `.BIMCraft-update-<pid>.app` beside the installed one, `hdiutil detach -force` whatever happened, `codesign --verify
--strict --deep` (as `packaging/macos/package.sh` does), the program the copy's Info.plist names run with `--version`, then `swap`:
two renames, the old app put back if the second fails and deleted once the new one is in, and `open -n <bundle> --args <project>`.
The tools are run by absolute path (`macos::Tools`), so tests point them at shell scripts (`tests::macos`; `tests::appimage` for the
AppImage; the one test that hands a file to the real `hdiutil` is skipped on a Mac, where nobody has seen what that does). Nothing of the macOS side has run on a Mac, and the AppImage side has run only against scripts that stand in for one.
None of the Windows side runs here: its sequencing is tested with shell scripts for
msiexec and the app (`tests::unix`), and what can't be tested is UAC, the real upgrade and the Program Files check on a real install.

## What comes from the network is hostile

Moved from the root `CLAUDE.md`. The reply and the download are capped, the installer's address is built from the release's tag and
never read from the reply, an asset is taken only if it is named exactly for the version and the kind of install
(`Target::asset_name`), uploaded, with a `sha256:` digest, and nothing runs that failed a check.
