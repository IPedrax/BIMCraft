# Families, forms, materials and textures

Moved from the root `CLAUDE.md`, word for word: the root keeps the rules and the map, and this file is read when the area is touched.

A family (`Model::families`, `family.rs`) is parameters, types that set them and forms in its own axes: x along a
component's angle, y to its left, z up from its base; a form is a profile in a sketch plane (`xy` swept up, `xz` along y,
`yz` along x), its sizes numbers or formulas, or triangles as a file brings them. A component places a type;
`Model::component_pieces` are its forms where it stands. Plans draw them from above, a form's edges hidden under a higher
form of the same component; sections show them beyond their line and never cut them (a `Solid::Mesh` is cut only where its `cut`
says, as a round run's tube is); the
3D view takes a form's triangles that share an edge and turn under 20° there as one curved surface, so a curve draws no
edge between its facets (`view3d::facets`) and shades smoothly across them, each corner lit by the angle-weighted mean of
its own surface's normals there, so a crease keeps its step (`corner_normals`); IFC writes each form as a closed face set,
triangles turned out, and reads one family per family name the file gives.

A form is swept, or with an `axis` turned about it (`family::revolve`: `from` to `to` degrees, 32 steps to a turn, the profile to
one side of the axis); a `void` cuts the solid forms listed before it (`csg::subtract`: convex polygons in binary space
partitions, built and walked with a worklist rather than recursion and bounded by a `Meter`, so a hostile shape ends in an error;
a cut piece keeps its uncut outline in plan). A family of category `door` or `window` is hosted: its `Width` and `Height` (English
names, whatever the project's language) size the wall's opening, `Sill Height` is a window's default sill, its forms are drawn in
the opening's axes (x along the wall from the middle of the opening, y across it from the wall's middle plane and + toward its
exterior, z up from the sill) and its formulas read `Wall Thickness`; its `symbols` also draw in plan (a door's swing). Its `connectors` say what an electrical device draws ([structure and MEP](structure-and-mep.md)); a family file keeps them. An
`Opening` holds a `family`, or none (one of the project's own types): `Model::opening_dims` gives its size either way
(`opening_type` returns it by value), its flips are mirrors (`opening_local`), and `Element::family()` is the one way to ask what
family a component or an opening is of. Sections show a family opening's forms beyond their line and never cut them.
How a door or a window opens is its family's `operation` (`model::Operation`: swing, double-swing, sliding, double-sliding,
folding, fixed), or for one of the project's own types the type's (`OpeningType::operation`); none, a door swings. IFC writes
it as the door's `OperationType` (`Operation::ifc_door`, its side from `flip_hand`: `SLIDING_TO_RIGHT`) and a window's
`PartitioningType` (two leaves, `DOUBLE_PANEL_VERTICAL`); the import reads a door's back, or its `IfcDoorType`'s (IFC4) or
`IfcDoorStyle`'s (IFC2x3), onto the type it makes. Schedules have it as the `Operation` field, in the project's language. A
window's panel operation (`IfcWindowPanelProperties`, a sliding sash) needs an `IfcWindowType`, which the export doesn't write yet.
What BIMCraft has no element for comes in from IFC as a component of a generic family that remembers the class it came in as
(`Family::ifc`, an `IfcClass`: `{"class": "IFCPLATE", "predefined": "CURTAIN_PANEL"}`): a covering that is no ceiling, a curtain
wall's panels and mullions, members that don't frame as a beam ([IFC import](ifc-import.md)), plates, duct fittings, terrain (`IfcGeographicElement`), a lift, anything the file builds
that has a body BIMCraft can read. The import reads it, after every element of BIMCraft's own, through the same path as
furniture (`import::ifc`'s `component`, families settled by `settle`): its predefined type is its own, else its type object's,
`NOTDEFINED` left out; its object type is remembered where it says what it is (the predefined type is `USERDEFINED`, or it isn't
the name the family and type take), so a family is one per name and class, and one of another class takes the name numbered on
(`Fin (2)`). Never generic: openings and the other features, virtual elements, annotations, spatial elements, grids, ports,
the structural analysis model (`import::NOT_GENERIC`), a part of an element that came in (a wall's or a roof's), and an
assembly (`IfcCurtainWall`, `IfcElementAssembly`) whose parts came in, which is left out and listed as such; one whose parts
have no body comes in itself. What stays out is listed by class, with what has no body BIMCraft can read said so, and the
`open` reply's `generic` counts what came in. The export (`Family::ifc` and `ifc/classes.rs`, IFC4's element classes as
`ci/ifc4_classes.py` reads them from the schema) writes a generic family's components as the class remembered, its attributes
after `Tag` as IFC4 lays them out (an element assembly's place ahead of its predefined type, a door's sizes), the predefined
type where IFC4's class takes it (else `.NOTDEFINED.`; nothing for a class with none, `IfcFlowSegment`), the object type
remembered else the `Family:Type` name, and a type object only where IFC4 has a `<CLASS>TYPE` that isn't abstract (none for a
`*StandardCase` or a flow terminal), with the predefined type but `USERDEFINED`, which a type object would have to name. A
class IFC4 doesn't have (IFC4X3's `IfcKerb`) goes out as a proxy, `USERDEFINED`, its object type the class. The `family`
command sets it (`ifc`, written in capitals, `null` to forget it) and `Family::check` refuses what IFC can't write: a class that
isn't `IFC` and capitals, a predefined type of anything but capitals, digits and `_`, an object type of more than a line. A
family of another category keeps what it remembers but goes out as its category says. An older BIMCraft leaves `ifc` out of
a project and opens it, its components going out as proxies, so the field took no `FORMAT` step.
A material's `texture` (`texture.rs`) is a pattern drawn in code or a picture of `Model::images` (a PNG or JPEG comes in, is kept
as a PNG of at most 1024 px, its header checked before the decoder makes room for it), laid on a face at its `size` in mm by the
face's own axes (`view3d::basis`: across is level, up goes up it, east and north where it lies flat), sampled per pixel from the
depth buffer, in the 3D view alone, from a mip chain. A triangle carries a skin (`view3d::skin`): in its low 24 bits a texture id (one more than its material's place in the
library), in its high 8 its material's `transparency`; `Scene::new` resolves the textures. A material's `transparency` (percent,
0 to 100, 0 opaque and not written, the starter Glass 70) is how see-through the 3D view draws what is made of it, with no view
override: a layer's skin wins over its element's, paint gives a face its own, and a family-less window's glass takes the Glass
material's. IFC carries it in `IFCSURFACESTYLESHADING`'s second argument (0 opaque to 1 clear, `$` for opaque), read back from a
shading or a rendering. Only the nearest see-through surface is blended, so a glass wall's far face and stacked glass don't
accumulate; plans and sections ignore it. Paint (`paint.rs`) is `{face: material}` in an element's `params` under `Paint`, a reserved
name: a triangle's face is read from its winding, so every solid emits triangles turned out (`Solid::tris`, `prism`), and
`Image::face` says which face a pixel is on. Favorites (`favorites.rs`) are a file of the user's own (`default_path`:
`BIMCRAFT_FAVORITES`, else the configuration folder) with materials and their pictures, families and their materials; they change
a project only through the `favorite` command (`load` never overwrites without `replace`). The desktop's Family Editor
(`editor.rs`) edits text (`FormText`, `ParamText`, ...) and changes the project's family only through a `family` command; its
preview is a scratch `Session` of its own, and it says what's wrong inside the window (the status box, over the view's corner, would lie on its
buttons).

A type of a category or of a family is renamed with `rename_type` (`Model::move_entry` moves it in its map, and `rename_entry` the
library entry and every reference `Model::lib_refs_mut` visits, so it keeps its GUID). A type or a family goes with `delete_type` (one entry, refused while an element uses it, and for the last type of a category or of a family: a
tool needs one to place) and `purge` (every entry of the kinds asked that nothing uses). Use is what `Model::lib_refs_mut` visits, the one place
that names every reference to a library entry: `Model::library_uses` counts them on a copy of the model, `Model::unused_entries` is one pass of
what purge takes out (each category keeps its default's type, else its first; a family that goes takes its types), the command repeats it
for what a pass frees (a family's material, a type's), at most 16 times, on a copy that becomes the model only when it isn't a `dry_run`.
`Model::remove_entry` is the single place that knows where each kind lives. The desktop's Purge Unused window (`purge.rs`) lists a dry run
for the kinds checked and runs the same; the Project Browser's Families lists the system types and has the right-click Delete.

The `family` command works out the whole change before the model is touched (`commands.rs::family`), so reading one costs no undo step
and a family `Model::check` would refuse never enters it. `family {name}` alone reads: the definition with every form's and symbol's `id`
and `GUID`, each type's `values` worked out, and `warnings` — no `model_mut()`, no file. Without `name` it lists the project's families
with their category and how much of each there is; `save` still writes one to a file. `dry_run: true` builds the change it's given
locally and replies `ok`, `warnings`, `changes` (parameters and types added, taken away and changed; forms and symbols replaced, patched
and deleted by id; the rename) instead of doing it; a refusal comes back as an error exactly as it would without it, carrying every error
and warning found, not only the first. One form or symbol is patched by its `id` or `guid` (`form`/`symbol`: its fields merged over what
that one holds, a `null` taking one away, its place, id and GUID kept; `delete_form`/`delete_symbol` to take it away), where `forms` and
`symbols` still replace whole lists — `keep_parts` binds by place, so patching is what leaves the other parts' ids alone. Validation is
`family/validate.rs` (`Family::problems`): every formula read at once (`names`, unknown parameters besides a hosted family's
`Wall Thickness`, syntax errors with the character they stop at), then `Family::check`, plus geometry warnings best worked out around
what doesn't build — a void reaching no solid before it, a form wholly outside its opening, one thicker than its wall, a door's or
window's plan with no symbols — each aggregated as `(in type …)`. `Family::shapes` gives each form's box before any void cuts it, from
the same `solid` `build` uses. `render {family, type, mode}` draws a family on its own: a `Session::new()` of its own holding the
project's materials and images, a wall of `wall_thickness` mm for a hosted family (a floor of its own footprint otherwise) with the type
in it, then `render_view` on that model — `3d`, `plan` (what its symbols draw) or `elevation` (front-on) — and the project keeps no
element and no undo step from it, the way the Family Editor's own preview already worked (`editor.rs::scratch`).


## Plan symbols

A family's `symbols`, of any category, are what its plan draws besides its forms, in its own axes: each is exactly one of a
`line` (up to `MAX_PROFILE` points), an `arc`, a `text` or a `dot`, with `visible` (a yes/no parameter or a formula) for any.
`Family::marks` works them out, for a type's values, as `Mark`s: a `Mark::Line` (an arc as chords of `ARC_STEP` degrees; a
label as a `Mark::Label`, lettered with `font.rs` by `lettering` where it is drawn) or a `Mark::Dot`. A `text` is `{at, height, value, align?}`: capitals `height` mm
tall, `at` the middle of the line, started, centred or ended there (`Align`); `{Parameter Name}` in `value` reads that parameter
(`said_text`: a number as plainly as it reads, a material by its name), an unknown name or an unclosed `{` is refused by
`Family::check`, and the lettered text is at most `MAX_TEXT` characters. `at` is the middle of the line of text vertically, and `align`
sets the horizontal anchor. A `dot` is a `Circle`, drawn solid in ink. Everything
numeric is checked finite and within `MAX_COORD`; a label's height and a dot's radius must be above zero.

`Model::component_marks` places a component's marks (mirrored, then turned and moved) and `Model::opening_marks` an opening's,
and `render::marks` draws them: lines in the category's pen (`BY_CATEGORY`, so Object Styles and Visibility/Graphics apply), dots
as filled discs. Coarse detail leaves them out. A label's anchor is placed with the component (turned, mirrored, moved) but its
letters never are: they are always drawn at 0 degrees in the view, left to right with a horizontal baseline, however the component
stands (the simplest rule; no flipping by quadrant). Symbols are annotation of the component's level: they draw in that level's
plan and its ceiling plan whatever height the component's forms reach (a ceiling light shows its symbols in the floor plan) and
on no other level's; the forms are outlined by the old rule (whole while any of them is between the view's depth and cut plane,
and not in ceiling plans). A component with no forms draws its symbols the same way. IFC export ignores symbols (they are plan notation, not geometry); the Family Editor's Symbols tab lists
all four parts. Library parts: a symbol of any kind has its own id and GUID (`HasPart`, `keep_parts`). A file written with
`text` or `dot` symbols, or symbols on a category other than a door or a window, is read by an older version only with them left
out or refused, so the file format is unchanged.


## Symbol sets

A symbol set (`symbol_set.rs`) is families that are a plan symbol and nothing else, loaded on demand and never part of a new
project: the starter fixtures (`fixtures.rs`) are in every project, and 76 more would crowd every family list. The
`symbol_set {set, names?}` command adds a set's families to the project (the Electrical tab's Symbols > Load AREI Symbols
button runs it); a family the project has by that name stays as it is, so loading twice changes nothing and an edited family is
never overwritten (`loaded` and `kept` in the reply). Each family has one type, `Standard`, no forms, and the symbols of
`crates/core/data/arei-symbols.json`, in the family `symbols` schema (mm, y up, the origin at the symbol's own origin): a
switch is in category `switch`, a socket in `outlet`, a data socket in `dataoutlet`, a light point or luminaire in `lighting`
and everything else (appliances, consumers, sources, domotics, protection) in `generic`, so the Device and Lighting Fixture
tools list their own kinds and the others are placed with the Component tool. They have no connectors, loads or 3D forms: they
are plan symbols only for now, and a family without a connector raises no warning in `inspect`.

The `arei` set is the graphical symbols of Table 2.23 of the AREI/RGIE (FOD Economie, Book 1), redrawn originally. The names
are those printed in its Dutch and French versions (`name_nl`, `name_fr` in the data), the English ones are working names. The
symbols are drawn at about 30 mm per drawing point, so a socket is about 25 cm wide on a plan. `names` (`en`, `nl`, `fr`) picks
the language of the family names; as given none, a French project gets the French wording, a Dutch project the Dutch
and every other language the English.


## Reloading a family

`family {path, name?, overwrite?}` can choose how to load over a family already in the project:

- `no` keeps the project definition and adds no undo step (`overwritten: false` in the reply).
- `version` replaces the definition but keeps compatible project parameter defaults and existing type values.
- `version_and_values` replaces the definition and takes its defaults and matching type values from the file.

Compatibility means the same case-sensitive parameter name, kind and Type/Instance setting, with neither version driven by
a formula. Incoming formulas always belong to the new definition. Project-only types remain, keeping compatible values;
new parameters and types use the incoming values. Explicit instance overrides are never rewritten by a family reload.
Optional definition fields omitted from an explicit replacement are reset, rather than retained from the old definition.
Parts keep identities through the existing `keep_parts` rule. Model validation refuses an incompatible reload atomically;
the normal undo restores a successful reload. `dry_run` previews the change without writing it.

An explicit reload of an identical definition is skipped with `overwritten: false`, without adding an undo step.

The option is only accepted with `path`, and is the caller's decision: a field named `overwrite` inside a family file cannot
choose the policy. With no option the original merge behaviour is preserved, including partial definitions. A family not
yet in the project is loaded normally under all three policies. This changes commands, not the saved file format.

The overwrite dialogs and nested shared-family decisions are separate UI work. Dimension references to family forms and
reference planes are not supported yet; reload does not silently delete project dimensions.

Load matches family and type names exactly, including case. The caller's `name` overrides the file's name. A new family name
creates a separate library definition; imported part identities are reconciled by the normal library sync and do not rename
or replace an existing family by GUID. A renamed type is added while the old type and its placed instances remain. Switching
instances to the new family or type is a separate explicit edit.
