# Families, forms, materials and textures

Moved from the root `CLAUDE.md`, word for word: the root keeps the rules and the map, and this file is read when the area is touched.

A family (`Model::families`, `family.rs`) is parameters, types that set them and forms in its own axes: x along a
component's angle, y to its left, z up from its base; a form is a profile in a sketch plane (`xy` swept up, `xz` along y,
`yz` along x), its sizes numbers or formulas, or triangles as a file brings them. A component places a type;
`Model::component_pieces` are its forms where it stands. Plans draw them from above, a form's edges hidden under a higher
form of the same component; sections show them beyond their line and never cut them (a `Solid::Mesh` is cut only where its `cut`
says, as a round run's tube is); the
3D view takes a form's triangles that share an edge and turn under 20° there as one curved surface, so a curve draws no
edge between its facets (`view3d::facets`) and shades smoothly across them, each corner lit by the angle-weighted mean of
its own surface's normals there, so a crease keeps its step (`corner_normals`); IFC writes each form as a closed face set,
triangles turned out, and reads one family per family name the file gives.

A form is swept, or with an `axis` turned about it (`family::revolve`: `from` to `to` degrees, 32 steps to a turn, the profile to
one side of the axis); a `void` cuts the solid forms listed before it (`csg::subtract`: convex polygons in binary space
partitions, built and walked with a worklist rather than recursion and bounded by a `Meter`, so a hostile shape ends in an error;
a cut piece keeps its uncut outline in plan). A family of category `door` or `window` is hosted: its `Width` and `Height` (English
names, whatever the project's language) size the wall's opening, `Sill Height` is a window's default sill, its forms are drawn in
the opening's axes (x along the wall from the middle of the opening, y across it from the wall's middle plane and + toward its
exterior, z up from the sill) and its formulas read `Wall Thickness`; its `symbols` are the plan lines (a door's swing). Its `connectors` say what an electrical device draws ([structure and MEP](structure-and-mep.md)); a family file keeps them. An
`Opening` holds a `family`, or none (one of the project's own types): `Model::opening_dims` gives its size either way
(`opening_type` returns it by value), its flips are mirrors (`opening_local`), and `Element::family()` is the one way to ask what
family a component or an opening is of. Sections show a family opening's forms beyond their line and never cut them.
How a door or a window opens is its family's `operation` (`model::Operation`: swing, double-swing, sliding, double-sliding,
folding, fixed), or for one of the project's own types the type's (`OpeningType::operation`); none, a door swings. IFC writes
it as the door's `OperationType` (`Operation::ifc_door`, its side from `flip_hand`: `SLIDING_TO_RIGHT`) and a window's
`PartitioningType` (two leaves, `DOUBLE_PANEL_VERTICAL`); the import reads a door's back, or its `IfcDoorType`'s (IFC4) or
`IfcDoorStyle`'s (IFC2x3), onto the type it makes. Schedules have it as the `Operation` field, in the project's language. A
window's panel operation (`IfcWindowPanelProperties`, a sliding sash) needs an `IfcWindowType`, which the export doesn't write yet.
A material's `texture` (`texture.rs`) is a pattern drawn in code or a picture of `Model::images` (a PNG or JPEG comes in, is kept
as a PNG of at most 1024 px, its header checked before the decoder makes room for it), laid on a face at its `size` in mm by the
face's own axes (`view3d::basis`: across is level, up goes up it, east and north where it lies flat), sampled per pixel from the
depth buffer, in the 3D view alone, from a mip chain. A triangle carries a skin (`view3d::skin`): in its low 24 bits a texture id (one more than its material's place in the
library), in its high 8 its material's `transparency`; `Scene::new` resolves the textures. A material's `transparency` (percent,
0 to 100, 0 opaque and not written, the starter Glass 70) is how see-through the 3D view draws what is made of it, with no view
override: a layer's skin wins over its element's, paint gives a face its own, and a family-less window's glass takes the Glass
material's. IFC carries it in `IFCSURFACESTYLESHADING`'s second argument (0 opaque to 1 clear, `$` for opaque), read back from a
shading or a rendering. Only the nearest see-through surface is blended, so a glass wall's far face and stacked glass don't
accumulate; plans and sections ignore it. Paint (`paint.rs`) is `{face: material}` in an element's `params` under `Paint`, a reserved
name: a triangle's face is read from its winding, so every solid emits triangles turned out (`Solid::tris`, `prism`), and
`Image::face` says which face a pixel is on. Favorites (`favorites.rs`) are a file of the user's own (`default_path`:
`BIMCRAFT_FAVORITES`, else the configuration folder) with materials and their pictures, families and their materials; they change
a project only through the `favorite` command (`load` never overwrites without `replace`). The desktop's Family Editor
(`editor.rs`) edits text (`FormText`, `ParamText`, ...) and changes the project's family only through a `family` command; its
preview is a scratch `Session` of its own, and it says what's wrong inside the window (the status box, over the view's corner, would lie on its
buttons).

A type of a category or of a family is renamed with `rename_type` (`Model::move_entry` moves it in its map, and `rename_entry` the
library entry and every reference `Model::lib_refs_mut` visits, so it keeps its GUID). A type or a family goes with `delete_type` (one entry, refused while an element uses it, and for the last type of a category or of a family: a
tool needs one to place) and `purge` (every entry of the kinds asked that nothing uses). Use is what `Model::lib_refs_mut` visits, the one place
that names every reference to a library entry: `Model::library_uses` counts them on a copy of the model, `Model::unused_entries` is one pass of
what purge takes out (each category keeps its default's type, else its first; a family that goes takes its types), the command repeats it
for what a pass frees (a family's material, a type's), at most 16 times, on a copy that becomes the model only when it isn't a `dry_run`.
`Model::remove_entry` is the single place that knows where each kind lives. The desktop's Purge Unused window (`purge.rs`) lists a dry run
for the kinds checked and runs the same; the Project Browser's Families lists the system types and has the right-click Delete.
