# Project parameters and schedules

Moved from the root `CLAUDE.md`, word for word: the root keeps the rules and the map, and this file is read when the area is touched.

(A distribution board's panel schedule is not one of these: it is a view of its own, `panel_schedule.rs`, in [structure and MEP](structure-and-mep.md).)

A project parameter (`Model::parameters`) is a value each element of its categories may hold in its `params`, of its kind;
a component's `params` hold its family's instance values too, so a parameter for components can't take a family
parameter's name, nor any category's own field's (`schedule::own_field`). A schedule's fields are its category's own
(`OWN` in `schedule.rs`, read from `element_json`), the project parameters for it and, for components, the families'
parameters, or calculated: a formula over the row's others, read as the family formula engine reads (lengths in mm, areas in
m²), a field with no value leaving it with none (an unset yes or no is no). Filters compare numbers as the schedule shows
them, so two that show the same are equal. The six schedules every project has (`schedule::VIEWS`) aren't elements
until changed or placed (`schedule::standard`), and a schedule named as one of them, in any language or case, is that one; renaming a parameter renames it in schedules, but a formula naming it holds
the rename back.
A component's Room Number and Room Name (as Revit's Room: Number and Room: Name) are the room it is in, found where it is
read and never stored (`Rooms::component`, the one rule `elements`, schedules, `load_points` and IFC share): the room on its
level whose boundary at the walls' centre lines holds its family's room calculation point (else its insertion point) in plan,
and whose height holds it, so an outlet on a wall's face is in the room on that side whatever the project measures rooms at
([families](families.md), `room_calculation_point`). `element_json` gives it as `room` (the room's GUID), `room_number` and
`room_name`; a component outside every room, or over or under it, has none.
A multi-category schedule (`of: "multicategory"`, `schedule::MULTI`, as Revit's Multi-Category Schedule) has a row for each
element of the categories it lists (`Schedule::categories`; none, every built one, `schedule::built`: not rooms, levels and
masses) and the fields they share (`SHARED`): Category (the element's, as elements name theirs), Family, Type, Level, Count,
Width, Height, Length, Thickness and Area, each its own category's field of that name where it has one holding the same and
empty where not (an area worked out for walls, length by height, and doors and windows, width by height; a roof's plan
area), and Material, its type's structure layer's (or its thickest's), a run's type's or a family's first material
parameter's. Its filters, sorting, grouping, totals and calculated fields are any schedule's; only it lists categories.
A table goes to a file as CSV (`schedule::to_csv`, text a spreadsheet would read as a formula guarded with `'`) or, for a path
ending `.xlsx`, as a workbook of one sheet (`schedule::to_xlsx` over `xlsx.rs`, which writes the parts and the zip by hand on
`flate2`): headings in bold, numbers as numbers so they sum, text as inline strings, which a spreadsheet never takes for a formula.

## The same numbers as Revit

`crosscheck.rs` holds the numbers schedules show against Revit's ([tools/revit-crosscheck](../../tools/revit-crosscheck/README.md)):
`export_crosscheck` describes a project in plain numbers (walls by their centre lines, floors, shafts, doors and windows,
rooms by their points), a script of ours builds it again in Revit and writes what Revit reports, `kind,id,quantity,value`
by our element ids, and `compare_crosscheck` (and the test `the_small_tower_has_the_numbers_revit_gives_it`, once Revit's
table of the small two-storey tower is committed) compares them quantity by quantity within `crosscheck::tolerance`.
Compared: each room's area, perimeter, whether it is enclosed, its unbounded height and its volume, each wall's length
along its centre line and its doors and windows, each floor's area less its openings and shafts, and its volume. Revit
reports more (a wall's area and volume) than we work out yet: those come back as `only_theirs`, the list of what is still
to do. Where the two define a quantity differently, the difference goes here, with the rule the comparison applies.

- A room's volume is its area times its unbounded height (from its level and base offset up to its upper limit and limit
  offset), which is Revit's while nothing under its top bounds it. Revit also stops a room's volume at a room-bounding
  ceiling, floor or roof lower than its top, and a ceiling bounds rooms unless told not to; we don't yet. The description
  gives Revit each room's limits as ours. The tower's rooms reach 300 mm under the level above (3.7 m, the `room`
  command's default), over their ceilings at 2.7 m: Revit's volume of them is their area times 2.7 m where ours is times
  3.7 m, the one difference the comparison is expected to show until volumes stop at ceilings.
- Each level's computation height (where walls and columns are cut to bound rooms) goes to Revit as the level's.
